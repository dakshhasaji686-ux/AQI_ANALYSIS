# AQI Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data to understand pollution levels using Python. The work focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights from real-world air quality data.

---

## Work Done
- Loaded AQI data from an Excel file
- Identified invalid AQI values (-200)
- Replaced invalid values with NaN
- Handled missing data using mean imputation
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis
- Created visualizations to study AQI distribution
- Analyzed patterns and derived key insights

---

## Key Insights
- AQI values show significant variation across the dataset
- Presence of extreme AQI values indicates unhealthy air conditions
- Visual analysis makes pollution patterns easier to understand
- Cleaned data leads to more reliable conclusions

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## File
- `AQi_analysis_Daksh.ipynb` – Complete data cleaning, visualization, and analysis

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how raw AQI data can be cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to gain useful insights about air quality. Proper data preprocessing is essential for accurate interpretation of environmental data.
